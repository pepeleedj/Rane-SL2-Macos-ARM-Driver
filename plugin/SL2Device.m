/*
 * SL2Device.m — Complete Self-Contained CoreAudio HAL Driver for Rane SL 2
 *
 * Drives the Rane SL 2 USB 2.0 DJ audio interface directly from inside the
 * CoreAudio HAL plugin (coreaudiod) using Apple's modern IOUSBHost framework.
 * No external daemon, no kernel extension, no root helper required.
 *
 * Capabilities:
 *   - 4-channel 24-bit (32-bit container) / 44.1 & 48 kHz Isochronous USB Audio
 *   - Low-latency playback: transfers queued 128 ms ahead, audio written into them shortly
 *     before they play; packet sizes predicted from the box's clock and steered to match capture
 *     (docs/SL2-AUDIO-ENGINE.md)
 *   - Automatic USB Audio / Analog Thru switching on StartIO / StopIO (HID 0x41)
 *   - Full HID Command/Response + Unsolicited Report Queue ('sl2h', 'sl2s', 'sl2q')
 *     for Serato DJ Pro (SL2Api.framework) and Control Panel
 *   - Automatic USB Hotplug detection (plug / unplug at any time): the device is listed only
 *     while a box is attached, and the decks are put on analogue thru when it connects
 *   - Bootloader detection: a box whose EEPROM firmware is missing/corrupt enumerates in the
 *     USB bootloader (bcdDevice 0x0000, "Unnamed Device") and passes no audio. The driver
 *     detects this and reports it — in the log and via a boot_mode flag in the 'sl2s' status —
 *     so a client can tell the box needs its firmware restored.

/* ============================================================================
 * Deep-schedule playback
 *
 * USB completions can be delivered 5-30 ms late (the delay is in the USB stack, before any
 * thread is woken, so no thread priority fixes it). So rather than filling each playback
 * transfer when an earlier one completes, DP_SLOTS 1 ms transfers are kept queued ahead,
 * zero-filled, and the HAL's IO thread (WriteMix) writes each sample straight into the queued
 * transfer that will carry it, shortly before that transfer starts. This works because the
 * controller reads a transfer's buffer when the transfer starts: audio written into a queued
 * ioDataWithCapacity: buffer before then is what gets sent. Completions only queue new transfers
 * at the far end of the schedule, so a stall in completion delivery does not interrupt the audio
 * unless it outlasts the queue: about 120 ms at small IO buffers (the 128 ms queued, less how far
 * ahead the HAL writes: about two IO buffers plus the safety offset).
 *
 * Each queued USB frame carries a contiguous run of HAL timeline positions, published in
 * g_dp_sched (indexed by frame number) for the IO thread to look up. When the schedule is
 * anchored (dp_anchor), its first frame carries the position DP_OUT_LATENCY_MS before that
 * frame's start time; because the packet sizes follow the box's clock, every sample then plays
 * DP_OUT_LATENCY_MS after its timeline position. The HAL writes each sample DP_OUT_SAFETY_MS
 * ahead of "now". Together (3.5 ms) they cover the up-to-1 ms span of positions within a frame
 * plus DP_WRITE_GUARD_FRAMES (1 ms), leaving 1.5 ms of margin for a late IO thread.
 *
 * Packet sizes are fixed when a transfer is queued, ~DP_SLOTS ms before it plays, so they cannot
 * be copied from the matching capture packets (implicit feedback). They are predicted from the
 * box's measured rate and steered (dp_track_capture) so that the frames sent through each USB
 * frame track the frames the box captured through it. A frame whose enqueue is refused is not
 * sent: its positions move to the next frame (the audio stays continuous) and it does not count
 * as sent, so the steering makes up the frames the box missed.

 *   audio, left-justified in 32 bits), so the frames whose first byte reads 0 are the ones that
 *   arrived.
 * - A packet is read only once its microframe has been over for CAP_SETTLE_UF microframes (one can
 *   be caught part-written during its microframe), and not if the kernel has already marked it
 *   errored in the transaction list.
 * - The early reader starts where the completions have got to (g_cap_prog_*: the next USB frame to
 *   complete, and the timeline position its first frame goes at), and walks forward packet by
 *   packet, placing each frame at the position the completion will. It stops at the first packet
 *   it can't read yet, a packet with no frames (missing or errored: the completion fills it with
 *   silence), or a USB frame with no transfer queued.
 * - The completion stays in charge. It writes every frame again (the same values), and keeps the
 *   clock tracking, the playback steering, the meters and the silence fills. If it places frames
 *   differently (an errored packet that still carried data), the early reader's position for the
 *   next USB frame doesn't match the completion's, and it starts again from the completion's.
 * - A buffer is tagged with its USB frame while queued (g_cap_tag), and 0 while it is refilled for
 *   its next frame. The early reader checks the tag before and after reading a packet, converting
 *   into a scratch buffer in between, so it never puts a refilled buffer's contents in the ring.

 * The gain is applied in ProcessMix: the HAL calls it in place on the mix of all its clients, in the
 * same IO cycle, just before WriteMix. Applying it there adds no buffering and moves no timing.
 * Every client follows the volume, Serato included. The driver keeps the levels and mute only in
