# hwtest.sh [--loopback] [--no-physical] — the SL 2 hardware tests in one run, with a PASS / FAIL /
# SKIP summary. Run by `make hwtest` (ARGS="--loopback ..."), which builds what it needs first.
#
# The tests run in the order that needs the fewest physical steps:
#   1. with the box attached, nothing else: driver status, SL2Api as Serato calls it (both slices),
#      sample-rate switching, the input safety offset setting, and the early capture read working;
#   2. with --loopback (a cable from Left Deck Out L to Left Deck In L; the tests play clicks and a
#      loud tone into that output, so pass it only when the cable is in): restarts, a glitch test,
#      48 kHz, the output volume and mute, the level meters, and in a debug build (installed with
#      make install DEBUG=1) the glitch test under load, the early capture read and the fault hooks;
#   3. unless --no-physical: steps for a person at the box (flip the LINE/PHONO switch, unplug and
#      replug while idle and while a stream runs). The script prints what to do and waits until it
#      sees the change, so nothing needs typing.
#
# Exit status 0 = nothing failed. The full output goes to a log file, named at the end.
